# TO-DO
DISCLAIMER: Some of this stuff might not be added in the future
* Add all the themes/levels from classic, alongside other ones from games such as Free with Magic. (I already ported Poached Eggs 1 and Free with Magic completely in a seasons 3.1.1 mod I started working on, so those will be easy)
* Maybe port some stuff from my 1.6.3 mod, like some of the custom birds and menus.
* Add an in-game help page or something similar
* Port the settings page that went unused in 1.0-1.6.3
